# Copy as Markdown â€” Tables Test

And attempt at integrating @joplin/turndown-plugin-jfm into turndown
in order to get Markdown tables.

So far it seems that perhaps linkedom (which we use instead of jsdom)
does not produce the required output. Specificaly the table node has no
rows property.

So it doesn't work.
