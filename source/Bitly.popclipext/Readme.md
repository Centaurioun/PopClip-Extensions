# Bitly

A PopClip extension to shorten a URL using [Bitly](https://bitly.com/).

The extension defines a single action called "Bitly" which is enabled only when the input contains one
or more web URLs. The action will shorten the all the URLs using the logged-in Bitly account, and paste back
the resulting text. (If the text is not editable, or Shift is held on the keyboard, PopClip will copy the result
to the clipboard instead.)

### Requirements

Requires PopClip 2021.11 or above, and a Bitly account.

### Author
