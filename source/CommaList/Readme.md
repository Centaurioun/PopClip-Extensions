## Description

The extension has two actions, both with the same icon, which appear only when the text selection contains a suitable input:

* The **Join with commas** action is available when the text selection contains more than one line (ignoring blank lines). It replaces the lines with a single-line comma-separated list.
* The **Split into lines** action is available when the text selection is a single line, with at least one comma. It replaces the commas (and any spaces around the commas), with newlines.
